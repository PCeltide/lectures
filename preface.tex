\chapter*{Preface}

This lecture course covers various topics around group rings of infinite groups.
We are motivated by geometric group theory but do not assume familiarity with it.
Most of the course will treat the Kaplansky conjectures.

The main reference text is Passman's book \cite{Passman} but we often deviate from it, either to cut a quicker path to the specific applications we are interested in or because of developments since its publication.
Some topics will use recent research articles.
